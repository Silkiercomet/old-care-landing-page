## Overview

This one is my first time using the design tool Figma, to create the layout of a website, at first my interactions with the tool where dull, like a monkey trying to fix a chopper, eventually i worked my way through the use and utilities of the tool and it really help's a lot at creating a layout, the result was a nice and rapidtly delivered layout created with HTML and CSS

## My process
 At first i was a little intimidated by figma but i was also excited by the idea of expanding my skills by learning a new tool, in reality it made everything faster, but i followed my to-go proces to create a layout starting from the header to the footer

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

the usage of a design tool is really a game changer for any developer who wants to improve his skill


### Continued development

even thou the desktop version work great on firefox and chrome, it still needs a mobile version to go along with it, the designer just gives the desktop version so i need to work my way around a mobile version for this site
